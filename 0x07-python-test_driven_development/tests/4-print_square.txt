How to use 4-print_square.py:
=============================

This module only contains one function called ``print_square()``.

``print_square()`` that prints a square with the character #. The
<size> argument is the length of the square.

USE:
====
~~
    >>> print_square = __import__('4-print_square').print_square


The function works as it should when size argument is an integer.
~~
    >>> print_square(4)
    ####
    ####
    ####
    ####

    >>> print_square(2)
    ##
    ##

    >>> print_square(0)


If the size argument is not an integer, then a TypeError exception
is raised.
~~
    >>> print_square('Five!')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: size must be an integer

    >>> print_square([3])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: size must be an integer

If <size> should not be less than 0, otherwise a ValueError is raised.
~~
    >>> print_square(-2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ValueError: size must be >= 0
