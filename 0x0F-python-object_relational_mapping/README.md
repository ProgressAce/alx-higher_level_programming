# Intro to databases and python
Python scripts that show the basic workings of connecting a MySQL database
to your python program.

In this introduction for the communication of databases and python, I use
two different modules to interact with a MySQL database server. Both depicting
independent ways of conversing with the database.
They are:
 - the MySQLdb module as the python DB API to connect to a MySQL database server
 - the SQLAlchemy module and its various features to implement an Object
   Relational Mapping(ORM) System.
